# portable-keylogger
A simple portable keylogger written in C++ using MS visual studio.
Simply run the exe file. After it does its magic the keys will be automatically saved into a LogFile.txt in the same directory. 

With a few simple modification you should be able to email the logfile to yourself.If thats what you want anyways.
